# Marble Game - Assignment 1
# Deadline: 14th November 2022 - 23:59

## Updates

  1) Deadline was changed to 14th November 2022 - 23:59
  1) The implementation of CMACS have been delayed to the 2nd assignment.

## Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your ability to control
the position and orientation of the hip of your leg.

You will demonstrate the control using a marble game. 

## Challenge 1: Open-Loop Control of the Two-Dimensional Marble Game

In this challenge, we will first demonstrate the ability to control the movement
of the hip. 

After constructing your leg assembly, add a two dimensional maze at the hip
of your robot. The size of the maze should be 11cm by 15cm. The goal is to roll
a golf or table tennis ball from the Start position to the Goal position.

The walls of your maze should be about 1cm tall. For a greater challenge, you 
can lower the height of the walls, especially the external walls. Then you have
to carefully control the speed of the ball, since it will otherwise jump out of
the maze.

### Servo Control 

First implement a program on the Raspberry PI to demonstrate control
of the four RC servos. 

Identify the maximum angles and home positions of your servos.

Make sure that you keep your leg assembly light, so that you can move the
hip given the RC servos.

### Remote Control 

Implement an application on the Raspberry PI to control the leg that
you constructed. 

Your application should be able to:

  * change the angles of each of the four servos

  * control the position and orientation of the hip of your leg

You can use a combination of keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, or joystick to control
your leg.

Use manual control to move the ball from the Start position to the Goal position.

### Camera Feedback

Mount the camera of the Raspberry PI so that you can watch your leg assembly
and the ball. 

Implement a program for the camera. I suggest a simple blob/color detector 
to estimate the position of the ball and angle of the hip of your leg.

### PID Control

Implement and tune a PID controller to try and balance the ball on the track, so that
it holds its position near the center of the playing field.

## Challenge 2: Closed Loop Control of the One-Dimensional Marble Game 

In this part of the challenge, we will simplify the maze to a single rail,
which runs from the front to the back of your maze.

        <tr>
        <td>
          A maze with a single rail for experiments in feedback control.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## Challenge 3: Closed Loop Control of the Two-Dimensional Marble Game 

In the third challenge, we extend our work to control the ball to balance
on a plane in two dimensions.

The maze is empty inside. The Start is at the top left and the goal is center of the
playing field.

### Camera

Modify your camera setup and vision application to estimate the position on the
top of the plane.

### PID Control

Add and tune an additional PID controller so that you can balance on the plane.

## Honesty declaration

By submitting an assignment, you claim that your submission is only your own work. 
This means that you have developed the design, implemented the code, run the experiments, 
and all other work necessary to complete the assignment by yourself.

If you discussed your work with other students or used sources on the Internet, then you **must**
say so clearly at the beginning of the assignment.

You can discuss parts of the assignment with others, but these discussions must be limited 
to sharing ideas on a whiteboard or notepad. If you exchange code/programs/designs or 
exchange any material via the Internet, then you must say so in your honesty declaration.

Fill out the [Honesty Declaration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9FyOFt--OL_cqse55b-CifBgPDfFZi2L6-sUQBvZ4I/edit?usp=sharing) 
and add any external sources that you used during the assignment.

## Submissions

This assignment must be done individually. 

If you use information or code that is not your own (e.g., sample code from the Internet, 
ideas for new features from a classmate, etc.), then you must specify this in your assignment 
write-up. Failure to disclose that you used external sources will lead to disciplinary actions.

To hand in your assignment:

  1) Create a directory to hold all of your data. The directory name should be \<student id\>_a\<number\>, 
     where \<student id\> is your student id and \<number\> is the number of the assignment,
  1) Create a directory source inside of the directory \<student id\>_a\<number\>. 
  1) Put the source code, which may contain of multiple files, for your assignmentâ€™s solution 
     into the directory source.
  1) Your prg\ram must compile by just running the command make in the source directory or a 
     similar step for your programming language of choice.
  1) Write a README file to explain anything you feel is necessary or important about your 
     submission. This may include special features/bugs of your program. Describe what parts 
     of the assignment you implemented. It is in your interest to simplify the job of the marker.
