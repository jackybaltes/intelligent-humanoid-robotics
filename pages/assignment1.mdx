# Marble Game - Assignment 1
# Deadline: 7th November 2023 - 23:59

## Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your ability to control
the position and orientation of the hip of your leg.

You will demonstrate the control using a marble game. 

## Challenge 1: Open-Loop Control of the Two-Dimensional Marble Game

In this challenge, we will first demonstrate the ability to control the movement
of the hip. 

After constructing your leg assembly, add a two dimensional maze at the hip
of your robot. The size of the maze should be 11cm by 15cm. The goal is to roll
a golf or table tennis ball from the Start position to the Goal position.

The walls of your maze should be about 1cm tall. For a greater challenge, you 
can lower the height of the walls, especially the external walls. Then you have
to carefully control the speed of the ball, since it will otherwise jump out of
the maze.

### Servo Control 

First implement a program on the Raspberry PI to demonstrate control
of the four RC servos. 

Identify the maximum angles and home positions of your servos.

Make sure that you keep your leg assembly light, so that you can move the
hip given the RC servos.

### Remote Control 

Implement an application on the Raspberry PI to control the leg that
you constructed. 

Your application should be able to:

  * change the angles of each of the four servos

  * control the position and orientation of the hip of your leg

You can use a combination of keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, or joystick to control
your leg.

Use manual control to move the ball from the Start position to the Goal position.

## Challenge 2: Closed Loop Control of the One-Dimensional Marble Game 

In this part of the challenge, we will simplify the maze to a single rail,
which runs from the front to the back of your maze.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', width:'40%'}}>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        ![maze2][maze2]
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>
        A maze with a single rail for experiments in feedback control.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

### Camera Feedback

Mount the camera of the Raspberry PI so that you can watch your leg assembly
and the ball. 

Implement a program for the camera. I suggest a simple blob/color detector 
to estimate the position of the ball and angle of the hip of your leg.

### PID Control

Implement and tune a PID controller to try and balance the ball on the track, so that
it holds its position near the center of the playing field.

### CMACs

Using feedback from the camera, implement the time inversion algorithm of
CMACs to try and control the ball on the rail.

## Challenge 3: Closed Loop Control of the Two-Dimensional Marble Game 

In the third challenge, we extend our work to control the ball to balance
on a plane in two dimensions.

The maze is empty inside. The Start is at the top left and the goal is center of the
playing field.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', width:'40%'}}>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        ![maze3][maze3]
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>
        A maze with a single rail for experiments in feedback control.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

### Camera

Modify your camera setup and vision application to estimate the position on the
top of the plane.

### PID Control

Add and tune an additional PID controller so that you can balance on the plane.

### CMACs

Extend your CMAC controller to balance the ball on the maze.
