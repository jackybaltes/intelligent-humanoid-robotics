<h1>Deadline: 27th November 2023 - 23:59</h1>
<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>1.) Page Opened, 6th Nov 2023.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your ability to control
the position and orientation of the hip of your leg or humanoid robot.</p>
<p>You will demonstrate the control using a rolling ball/marble game.</p>
<p>The assignment must be done in groups of no more than 2 students.</p>
<h2>Construction</h2>
<p>Your group can do the assignment using an Engineering Kit 2, OP-2, or OP-3
humanoid robot available in the ERC lab.
You can also decide to build your own robot leg.</p>
<h2>Challenge 1: Open-Loop Control of the Two-Dimensional Marble Game</h2>
<p>In this challenge, we will first demonstrate the ability to control the movement
of the hip.</p>
<p>After constructing your leg assembly, add a two dimensional maze at the hip
of your robot. The size of the maze should be 11cm by 15cm. The goal is to roll
a golf or table tennis ball from the Start position to the Goal position.</p>
<p>The walls of your maze should be about 1cm tall. For a greater challenge, you
can lower the height of the walls, especially the external walls. Then you have
to carefully control the speed of the ball, since it will otherwise jump out of
the maze.</p>

<h3>Servo Control</h3>
<p>First implement a program to demonstrate control
of the leg and hip of your humanoid robot.</p>
<p>Identify the maximum angles and home positions of your servos.</p>
<p>If you built your own robot leg, make sure that you keep your
leg assembly light, so that you can move the
hip given the RC servos.</p>
<h3>Remote Control</h3>
<p>Implement an application  to control the angles of the joints.</p>
<p>Your application should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>change the angles of each of at least four servos</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>control the position and orientation of the hip of your leg.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use a combination of keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, or joystick to control
your leg.</p>
<p>Use manual control to move the ball from the Start position to the Goal position.</p>
<h3>Camera Feedback</h3>
<p>Mount a webcam so that you can watch your leg assembly
and the ball.</p>
<p>Implement a program for the camera. I suggest a simple blob/color detector
to estimate the position of the ball and angle of the hip of your leg.</p>
<h3>PID Control</h3>
<p>Implement and tune a PID controller to try and balance the ball on the track, so that
it holds its position near the center of the playing field.</p>
<h2>Challenge 2: Closed Loop Control of the One-Dimensional Marble Game</h2>
<p>In this part of the challenge, we will simplify the maze to a single rail,
which runs from the front to the back of your maze.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;width:40%"><table><tbody><tr><td><p><img src="./maze2.svg" alt="maze2"/></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A maze with a single rail for experiments in feedback control.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<h3>Camera</h3>
<p>Modify your camera setup and vision application to estimate the position on the
top of the plane.</p>
<h3>PID Control</h3>
<p>Add and tune an additional PID controller so that you can balance on the plane.</p>
<h2>Honesty declaration</h2>
<p>By submitting an assignment, you claim that your submission is only your own work.
This means that you have developed the design, implemented the code, run the experiments,
and all other work necessary to complete the assignment by yourself.</p>
<p>If you discussed your work with other students or used sources on the Internet, then you <strong>must</strong>
say so clearly at the beginning of the assignment.</p>
<p>You can discuss parts of the assignment with others, but these discussions must be limited
to sharing ideas on a whiteboard or notepad. If you exchange code/programs/designs or
exchange any material via the Internet, then you must say so in your honesty declaration.</p>
<p>Fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9FyOFt--OL_cqse55b-CifBgPDfFZi2L6-sUQBvZ4I/edit?usp=sharing">Honesty Declaration</a>
and add any external sources that you used during the assignment.</p>
<h2>Submissions</h2>
<p>This assignment must be done in groups of maximal two students.</p>
<p>If you use information or code that is not your own (e.g., sample code from the Internet,
ideas for new features from a classmate, etc.), then you must specify this in your assignment
write-up. Failure to disclose that you used external sources will lead to disciplinary actions.</p>
<p>To hand in your assignment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a directory to hold all of your data. The directory name should be &lt;student id&gt;_a&lt;number&gt;,
where &lt;student id&gt; is your student id and &lt;number&gt; is the number of the assignment,</li>
<li>Create a directory source inside of the directory &lt;student id&gt;_a&lt;number&gt;.</li>
<li>Put the source code, which may contain of multiple files, for your assignmentâ€™s solution
into the directory source.</li>
<li>Your prg\ram must compile by just running the command make in the source directory or a
similar step for your programming language of choice.</li>
<li>Write a README file to explain anything you feel is necessary or important about your
submission. This may include special features/bugs of your program. Describe what parts
of the assignment you implemented. It is in your interest to simplify the job of the marker.</li>
