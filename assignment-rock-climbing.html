<h1>Deadline: 29th December 2023 - 23:59</h1>
<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>1.) Page Opened, 22nd Dec 2023.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of this assignment is to investigate some preliminary ideas
for a motion planner for a rock climbing robot.</p>
<p>This assignment is only done in simulation, but we will host
the competition for physical robots during FIRA 2024.</p>
<p>The assignment must be done in groups of no more than 2 students.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Rock climbing is an interesting and challenging problem for humans
and robots.</p>
<p>Professional climbers are able to scale impressive boulders.</p>

<p>&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>I beleive it will be several decades before robots will match the skills of
humans in this regard. Here is a video of one of our first attempts at a rock climbing
robot.</p>

<p><strong>Note that you only need to implement a simpile simulation of the robot
to complete your motion planner.</strong></p>
<h2>Challenge 1:</h2>
<p>We would like to extend our previous work by adding several different types
of holds, similar to the ones in a rock climbing gym.</p>
<h3>Environment Setup</h3>
<p>The field is a vertical wall of a given size (width * height).
Various holds are setup in that wall.</p>
<p>We design three different holds that have different properties.</p>
<p><img src="./holds.svg" alt="holds"/></p>
<p>The center hold will support any contacts, whereas the left and right holds
will only support if the robot is to the right or the left of the
hold respectively.</p>
<h3>Robot Model</h3>
<p>The robot is modeled as a rectangle of size 15cm * 20cm (for the torso).
Arms and legs are mounted on the vertices of the rectangle.</p>
<p>The arms
and legs have a minimum length of 7cm and a maximum length of 14cm.
The arms and legs can rotate 360 deg.</p>
<p>In this assignment, we will only consider the kinematics of the robot.</p>
<h3>Create a Bouldering Problem</h3>
<p>Implement a program to generate randomized bouldering environments by putting
various holds onto a playing field.</p>
<h3>Motion Planning</h3>
<p>We consider a position stable is the robot is able to hold at least three
holds.</p>
<p>Implement a path planner that can select a series of arms and leg motions
and holds, so that the robot can climb up the wall.</p>
<p>You can use standard weak methods in AI
(e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">depth first search</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">breadth first search</a>,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing">hill climbing</a>)
or a heuristic search method (A*).</p>
<p>Another approach is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcemenet learning</a>.</p>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>Implement at least two algorithms and compare their performance on
a series of bouldering problems.</p>
<h2>Honesty declaration</h2>
<p>By submitting an assignment, you claim that your submission is only your own work.
This means that you have developed the design, implemented the code, run the experiments,
and all other work necessary to complete the assignment by yourself.</p>
<p>If you discussed your work with other students or used sources on the Internet, then you <strong>must</strong>
say so clearly at the beginning of the assignment.</p>
<p>You can discuss parts of the assignment with others, but these discussions must be limited
to sharing ideas on a whiteboard or notepad. If you exchange code/programs/designs or
exchange any material via the Internet, then you must say so in your honesty declaration.</p>
<p>Fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9FyOFt--OL_cqse55b-CifBgPDfFZi2L6-sUQBvZ4I/edit?usp=sharing">Honesty Declaration</a>
and add any external sources that you used during the assignment.</p>
<h2>Submissions</h2>
<p>This assignment must be done in groups of maximal two students.</p>
<p>If you use information or code that is not your own (e.g., sample code from the Internet,
ideas for new features from a classmate, etc.), then you must specify this in your assignment
write-up. Failure to disclose that you used external sources will lead to disciplinary actions.</p>
<p>To hand in your assignment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a directory to hold all of your data. The directory name should be &lt;student id&gt;_a&lt;number&gt;,
where &lt;student id&gt; is your student id and &lt;number&gt; is the number of the assignment,</li>
<li>Create a directory source inside of the directory &lt;student id&gt;_a&lt;number&gt;.</li>
<li>Put the source code, which may contain of multiple files, for your assignmentâ€™s solution
into the directory source.</li>
<li>Your prg\ram must compile by just running the command make in the source directory or a
similar step for your programming language of choice.</li>
<li>Write a README file to explain anything you feel is necessary or important about your
submission. This may include special features/bugs of your program. Describe what parts
of the assignment you implemented. It is in your interest to simplify the job of the marker.</li>
