<h2>Online Tools</h2>
<p>Some of the classes will be conducted online using the following setup.</p>
<p>The course will use the following <a href="http://www.discord.com">Discord</a> server
to support discussions.</p>

<h2>Textbook and Lecture Materials</h2>
<p>I will use research papers describing both the background material as well as the
current state of the art.
Students are expected to understand the material as well as being able to implement
simple versions of the described algorithm.</p>
<h2>Academic Dishonesty</h2>
<p>Students are reminded that there are penalties for academic dishonesty.
Academic dishonesty includes submitting assignments that are not entirely the studentâ€™s own work.
A declaration sheet, which states that the work being submitted is completely your own, is  available here
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VBXr9XeQqVWjMotxhb0qhim5mFffQ85YU86El-wlkZ0/edit?usp=sharing">honesty declaration</a>.
This sheet must be filled out and attached to all assignments or projects,
which you are submitting as part of your class work.
No assignment or project will be marked unless the declaration is attached.</p>
<h2>Registration Advisory</h2>
<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that you are entitled to be registered in this course. If you are not entitled to be in this course, you will be withdrawn, or the course may not be used in your degree program. There will be no fee adjustment. This is not appealable.
