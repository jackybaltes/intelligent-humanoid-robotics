<h2>Content</h2>
<p>This course covers a theory and fundamental problems in intelligent humanoid robotics.
The techniques will be showcased using practical applications.</p>
<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>Your grade in the course depends on the result of the following assessments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Assignment 1: 20%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Midterm Test: 20%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assignment 2: 20%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Final Exam: 40%</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lecture Slides</h2>
<p>A list of lecture slides is available in the chat server</p>
<h2>Assignments and Projects</h2>
<p>Assignments should be done individually.</p>
<p>The goal is to actually build a small dynamic humanoid robot.
We will announce details of the hardware etc. at a later stage.</p>
<h2>Sample Code</h2>
<p>The following are links to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18TSF6F15nZ7AW1VShVf3-5WWAUc-NJho?usp=sharing">Jupyter notebooks</a> that we used in class.</p>
<p>The notebooks can be run on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google colaboratory</a> or you can download them and run them
on your own machine/server.</p>

<p>You may also enjoy some of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eP23cwBwAqt549CvP7UGjrhvHRDwdQKp?usp=sharing">python programming exercises</a>.</p>
<h2>Online Tools</h2>
<p>Some of the classes will be conducted online using the following setup.</p>
<p>The course will use the following <a href="http://www.discord.com">Discord</a> server
to support discussions.
The link to the discord server is <a href="https://discord.gg/VpdrMyKr">https://discord.gg/VpdrMyKr</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure that you pay attention to the messages on the server. Links to
additional course material, assignments, and tests will be posted on discord only.</p>
<h2>Textbook and Lecture Materials</h2>
<p>I will use research papers describing both the background material as well as the
current state of the art.
Students are expected to understand the material as well as being able to implement
simple versions of the described algorithm.</p>
<h2>Academic Dishonesty</h2>
<p>Students are reminded that there are penalties for academic dishonesty.
Academic dishonesty includes submitting assignments that are not entirely the studentâ€™s own work.
A declaration sheet, which states that the work being submitted is completely your own, is  available here
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VBXr9XeQqVWjMotxhb0qhim5mFffQ85YU86El-wlkZ0/edit?usp=sharing">honesty declaration</a>.
This sheet must be filled out and attached to all assignments or projects,
which you are submitting as part of your class work.
No assignment or project will be marked unless the declaration is attached.</p>
<h2>Registration Advisory</h2>
<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that you are entitled to be registered in this course. If you are not entitled to be in this course, you will be withdrawn, or the course may not be used in your degree program. There will be no fee adjustment. This is not appealable. Please be sure to read the course description for this
and every course in which you are registered.</p>
<h2>Major Disruptions</h2>
<p>Should major disruptions to university activities occur as a result of a pandemic,
the course content, marks breakdown, and other provisions of this document may be
adjusted as the circumstances warrant.</p></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"QTfxsXSdeDAVt8EEizt_I","assetPrefix":"/intelligent_humanoid_robotics","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
